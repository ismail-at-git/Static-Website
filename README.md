This is a basic static website built using fundamental web development technologies: HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling its presentation. The site features multiple pages, including a homepage, an about page, and a contact page, providing a foundational multi-page web experience.

**Built With:**

* **HTML:** Used to define the semantic structure and content of each page.
* **CSS:** Employed for styling the layout, visual appearance, and overall design of the website. Basic responsiveness has been implemented using CSS media queries to ensure a decent viewing experience across different screen sizes.

**What I Learned:**

Through the process of building this website, I gained practical experience in:

* **HTML Structure:** Creating well-organized and semantic HTML markup for different content sections, including navigation bars, main content areas, images, and footers.
* **CSS Styling:** Applying CSS rules to control the visual aspects of the website, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.
* **Multi-Page Navigation:** Implementing a navigation system to allow users to easily move between the different pages of the website.
* **Image Integration:** Embedding and managing images within the website content.
* **Basic Responsiveness:** Utilizing CSS media queries to adapt the website's layout for different screen widths, providing a more consistent user experience on various devices.

This project serves as a solid foundation for understanding the core building blocks of web development and demonstrates the ability to create a functional, multi-page static website.
